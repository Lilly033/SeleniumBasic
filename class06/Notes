Alerts:
Alert is a pop up message! Alert takes a complete focus of our main page that we are
   working on .
We can not proceed until it is handled.

3 types of Alerts:
     1) bew based alert/ htlm alerts - we can simply inspect and preform need action
     2) Javascript alerts/ browser alert -we can handle these alerts by using switchTo method
                                                          we can not inspect!
     3) Windows based alerts - we can not handle with Selenium!

     Types of Java script alerts:
 1) Simple alert -  click ok.
 2) confirmation alert - either cancel or click ok
 3) prompt alert- enter the text and then click ok  or cancel

     To handle Java Script alerts  we have 4 methods:
 1) accept() - click ok
 2) dismiss() - click cancel
 3) getText()
 4) sendKeys()

 To handle authentication alerts we need to pass username and password in the url
   public static String url = "https://admin:admin@the-internet.herokuapp.com/basic_auth";
                                    //username:password@

    ----     Frames   ---- iframe
 Frame is separate independent window in our webpage
 Frames allow devs to represent multiple views on the page

 3 ways to interact with Frames:
   1) by index
   2) by name or ID
   3) by WebElement

 in alerts - switch to alert and switch automatically back
 in frames - switch to frame manually and switch manually back to the main page

 Interview question:
 How do you handle Alerts in Selenium???
 We handle Alerts by using Alert interface !!!
